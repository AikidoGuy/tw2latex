tw2latex
========

Task Warrior to LaTeX python utility.

This is being made available sooner that I was planning because I received an email request
for it. Please be aware that it is a work in progress.

Usage
-----
- $ vi tw2latex.py           # and modify settings near top of file to suit your needs
- $ chmod 700 tw2latex.py
- $ ./tw2latex.py            # to get a list of all options
